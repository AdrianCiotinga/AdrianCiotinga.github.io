    <p>Welcome to Bits of Intelligence, the personal blog of Adrian Ciotinga! Here, I dive into the fascinating world of AI/ML and share my thoughts, insights, and discoveries with fellow data enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Who am I? I’m Adrian, a passionate data scientist with an interest in all things “deep learning.” Through this blog, I aim to document my journey as I explore the vast landscape of artificial intelligence and machine learning. From literature reviews to personal projects, and even the latest AI/ML stories making waves in the media, you’ll find it all here.</p>

<p>At Bits of Intelligence, I believe in the power of small but significant advancements. While major breakthroughs often steal the spotlight, it’s the incremental progress and novel ideas that truly shape the future of AI/ML. With each post, I aim to uncover those hidden gems, those “bits” of intelligence that may not always make headlines but hold immense value for the data science community.</p>

<p>Expect a mix of content on this blog. Sometimes, you’ll find in-depth literature reviews where I dissect the latest research papers, distilling complex concepts into bite-sized explanations. Other times, I’ll take you along on my personal AI/ML projects, sharing insights and lessons learned along the way. And of course, I’ll keep you updated on the biggest AI/ML stories making waves in the media, offering my own takes on their implications.</p>

<p>While it may get slightly technical at times, my hope is that data scientists and enthusiasts of all levels will be able to enjoy some aspects of this blog. I’d also love to hear your thoughts! Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/AdrianCiotinga/AdrianCiotinga.github.io/issues">leave a comment here as an issue</a> or <a href="mailto:aciotinga@gmail.com">reach out to me privately via e-mail</a>.</p>
